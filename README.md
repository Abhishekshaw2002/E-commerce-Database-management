# Key SQL queries include:
1: Retrieve all Products by Sales:
SELECT 
    P.ProductName, 
    SUM(OD.Quantity) AS TotalUnitsSold, 
    SUM(OD.Price * OD.Quantity) AS TotalRevenue
FROM 
    OrderDetails OD
JOIN 
    Products P ON OD.ProductID = P.ProductID
GROUP BY 
    P.ProductName
ORDER BY 
    TotalRevenue DESC;
